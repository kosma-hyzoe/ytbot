# ytbot

A YouTube bot I did for one of my tech interviews.

## How to run

1. Install requirements from `requirements.txt`
1. Modify configuration in `ytbot/config.py` if needed
1. Run `python3 -m ytbot` in the repo directory

Test with `pytest`.

## Issues and limitations

pytest doesn't recognize the `humanfriendly` library well when
run from command line, works in an IDE though. I consider it
low-priority for now, but will try to fix it soon.

the following steps:

1. Open Chrome browser installed on the hosting system
